Before we can get started with implementing the SDK, you should retrieve your API Key for your integration from the Revlum Dashboard.

You must initialise the SDK before you can use it. You can do so with the following code.

    Offerwall.configure(apiKey = "wpvnaqodiv6lc9nsm6mw16ds8yo5x1", userId = "test-user")
